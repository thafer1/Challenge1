# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

With the ever-growing number of users and prevalence of search engines it is important for web development to be forward thinking. This goal of this project is to refactor existing code to streamline this website and make it more accessible. After completion the HTML and CSS should be optimized and easier to parse. Throughout this process I have learned how important it is to have code succint and accessible.
